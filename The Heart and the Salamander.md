## 1. Why does Montag grin with a “fierce grin” (p. 9) before and after he is fighting fires?

* Montag feels good, while he is doing it because he likes his job as a firefighter in the dystopian society. Books are illegal in that world so he is 'like' a defender of the law. 

## 2. Describe Clarisse—how does she look and act? How is her face like a candle in the light it gives off? Give specific details.

* She looks older than she really is. She has dark shiny eyes. Her face is thin and pale. Clarisse loves the nature and acts curious. The 17 year old girl is interested in other people and she is friendly. She is questioning everything and is not materialistic or fun addicted.


## 3. What is the effect of Clarisse’s questions on Montag? Why do her questions have this effect?

* Clarisse asks Montag "Are you happy?" this is a great turning point for the plot. Montag changes his view about his life and his work.

* After the conversation, Montag sees no more great sense in his work and questions it!


## 4. Compare Montag’s wife, Mildred, with Clarisse. Are they alike in any way? How are they different?

* Mildred is a typical citizen, so she is fun addicted, superficial and egocentric. Montags wife also tries to kill herself with medicine (sleeping pills).

* Clarisse is an antipole to the typical citizen. She is curious and questions things. The antipole loves the nature and is interested in other people. She is also peacful, is not materialistic and not fun adicted. Clarisse was run over by a car (probably). (died)

## 5. What is Montag’s reaction when he discovers his wife has taken an overdose of sleeping pills? Why does he react this way? Does he love his wife?

*  Montag does not do anything really. He calls a doctor, then Mildred's stomach is pumped out. He does not really love his wife because he is interested in Clarisse. The bad things that are happening make him feel depressed and he starts to hate his job.

## 6. What is the effect of the wall-sized TVs on Mildred? What kinds of programs are playing on them?

## 7. Why are Clarisse and Montag fascinated with each other? What do they find attractive; what do they find upsetting about each other?

## 8.Why does the mechanical hound growl and threaten Montag?

* The dog only threatens people who read books

## 9. Clarisse says, “I haven’t any friends. That’s supposed to prove I’m abnormal” (p. 29 ff.). Is Clarisse abnormal? What does she do that keeps people her own age from relating to her?

## 12. Why does Beatty call books a “Tower of Babel” (p. 38f)

* because the tower of babel is a very important topic in the bible and seems to be hope for Beatty. 
* bible: people wanted to reach or connect with god; didn't work out;
* If people pile up books (knowledge), they feel more intelligent compared to others (and the system) - criticism would be the result. Beatty doesn't want this.
* Beatty wants to keep conformity. He fears conflicts / revolts;

## 13. When Montag returns home after the house and book burning and the death of the woman, he makes “soft sounds.” What are these sounds, and why is he making them?

## 15. According to Beatty, the numbers of different minorities were a problem because they caused controversy (p. 54 ff.). How does the society try to eliminate controversy, and how effective are they in achieving this goal?
