# Docsify-This Guest Talks

Are you teaching a UX, Web/Software design, open-source development, or educational technology course in Vancouver/Burnaby/Surrey this Fall?

If so, I’m currently offering guest talks/discussions for local in-person classes focused on the design and development of my open-source project, [Docsify-This.net](https://Docsify-This.net) (a finalist of the 2024 Open Education Global Awards in the Open Infrastructure category https://awards.oeglobal.org/2024-finalists/). These case studies highlight practical strategies for designing and developing open source Web app projects, with insightful examples for both students and instructors.

## 1️⃣ Strategies for Open-Source Success: Building the Docsify-This Project
Overview: Learn key strategies for developing and sustaining a small-scale open source project like Docsify-This.

Possible topics include:
- Communicate purpose and value
- Highlight problems your project solves
- Provide demo functionality/content
- Twin development with documentation
- Publicly share works-in-progress
- Maintain focus on first-use experience
- Engage with users where they are
- Consider project sustainability up-front

## 2️⃣ The Open Source Docsify-This Project: An Interaction Design Case Study
Overview: Explore the design techniques that made Docsify-This a user-friendly tool through real-world interaction design practices.

We’ll discuss various applied techniques, which may include:
- Mapping user (friction) journeys
- Prioritizing job stories
- Optimizing key task flows
- Reducing barriers of use
- Harnessing the power of microcopy
- Applying progressive (workflow) disclosure
- Incorporating documentation into UX design

## 3️⃣ Big Design, Small Design: A Case Study of the Open Source Project Docsify-This
Overview: Explore the balance between high-level strategy and detailed design in the building of Docsify-This.

Examples of Big Design:
- Barriers to open publishing
- Problems and opportunities
- Outcomes over outputs
- People + Systems
- Mapping user (friction) journeys
- Prioritizing job stories

Examples of Small Design:
- First-use experience
- Optimizing key task flows
- Reducing barriers of use
- Harnessing the power of microcopy
- Applying progressive (workflow) disclosure
- Using docs as part of UX design

If any of the above sounds of interest, message me via LinkedIn or email at paul@hibbittsdesign.org and we can discuss possibilities. I’m also happy to work with you to tailor these case studies to fit your course focus and student needs.
