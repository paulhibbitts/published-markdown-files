**Title**  
Using Docsify-This for Publishing, Sharing and Reusing Markdown-based Open Content. 

**Description**  
While the system-independent format of Markdown is supported in more and more contexts, there are still challenges to quickly and easily publish Markdown content on the Web. Docsify-This (based on Docsify.js.org) provides an easy on-ramp to publishing, sharing and reusing open Markdown content with no website setup or build process required. As long as a Markdown file is publicly available, it can be instantly turned into a responsive standalone web page, and multiple Markdown files can even be linked together to provide a simple website. In addition, if GitHub or Codeberg are used to store Markdown files an "Edit this Page" link can be automatically provided for each page to better support collaborative authoring.
