# Leap into Open Publishing with Docsify-This!

This interactive session invites tech-curious educators and authors to take the leap into the world of open publishing. We'll explore how Docsify-This, an open source tool built with Docsify.js.org (30K+ GitHub stars), significantly lowers barriers by transforming public Markdown files into styled web pages without requiring technical infrastructure.

Docsify-This embodies key open education principles through six core design guidelines: _Zero Maintenance Markdown Publishing_ eliminates technical barriers, users simply paste a Markdown URL to generate styled webpages. _Platform independence over vendor lock-in_ ensures content portability, leveraging Markdown's system-independent nature and ever-growing adoption, while _Your content, your control_ means files remain in original locations (GitHub, Codeberg, personal servers, etc.).

_Separation of Content and Presentation_ enables the same Markdown to function as standalone websites or embedded LMS content through URL-based customization. _Support for the 5 Rs of OER_ provides automatic "Edit this Page" links and template repositories for remixing. _Authors helping other authors_ manifests through shareable configurations and community templates.

What participants will learn:

* Describe Docsify-This's purpose and key usage scenarios
* Display Markdown files as web pages using the Web Page Builder
* Change visual appearance of rendered pages
* Share and reuse Docsify-This content across platforms

Session format: Live demonstrations using [https://Docsify-This.net](https://docsify-this.net) enable immediate hands-on experimentation. Participants will explore examples, see potential applications, experience some of the most recent enhancements, and learn valuable tips and techniques from the project author.
