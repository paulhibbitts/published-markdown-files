# Whatâ€™s Been Cooking with the Open-Source Web Publishing Tool Docsify-This?

With Markdown support expanding from AI tools to learning platforms and beyond, transform online Markdown files into styled webpages in seconds, or create entire websites - no hosting, no coding, no cost. Join open source author and former SFU instructor Paul Hibbitts for an interactive look at significant developments since 2023 that have made [Docsify-This.net](https://docsify-this.net) an even more capable OER publication and course content platform.

Discover new examples, templates and layouts, and load-and-go styling settings for seamless LMS embedding. Driven by the six core design principles[^1] of Docsify-This that enable rapid, flexible content sharing, explore recent features like custom image grids, presentation-optimized display settings for online sessions and workshops, URL parameter support for sharing styling configurations, and non-Docsify-This branded alias domains.
